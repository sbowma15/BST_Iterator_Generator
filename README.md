# BST_Iterator_Generator

# Overview

This Python program, BST_Iterator_Generator.py, is designed as part of the homework assignment for the "Principles of Programming Languages" course (CS3210) in the Fall of 2022. The program focuses on implementing an iterator for a Binary Search Tree (BST).


# Usage

The program defines a BST class representing a Binary Search Tree.
The constructor of the BST class takes a list of strings as labels for the nodes, creating the tree accordingly.
The _add method adds nodes to the tree recursively.
The _print method generates a string representation of the BST using recursion.
The in_order method (TODO #1) is designed to return one element at a time from the BST's given node, respecting in-order tree traversal.
The program includes sample code to create a tree and print its structure.
